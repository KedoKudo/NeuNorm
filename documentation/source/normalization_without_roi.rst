Normalization without ROI
*************************

If you don't want any normalization ROI, simply run the normalization

>>> o_norm.normalization()

How to get the normalized data

Each of the data set in the sample and ob will then be normalized.
If a norm_roi has been provided, the sample arrays will be divided by the average of the 
region defined. Same thing for the ob. Those normalized array can be retrieved this way

>>> sample_normalized_array = o_norm.data['sample']['data']
>>> ob_normalized_array = o_gretting.data['ob']['data']
